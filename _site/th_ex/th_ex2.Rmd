# Overview

In this take-home exercise, I will critic [Ding Yanmu](https://dingyanmu.netlify.app/th_ex/th_ex1.html)'s Take-home Exercise 1 submission in terms of clarity and aesthetics. I will also remake the original design by applying the data visualisation principles and best practice we had learnt in Lesson 1 and 2.

# Getting Started

We will first install and launch the required R packages using the code chunk below.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'ggdist', 'ggridges', 'patchwork', 'ggthemes', 'ggrepel')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

We will also import the *Participants.csv* from the data folder into R using the code chunk below.

```{r}
participants <- read_csv("data/Participants.csv")

glimpse(participants)
```

# Critic 1
- Original Design

- Critic

There is a typo with the title as shown in the picture above. This affects the overall aesthetics of the article.

- Makeover

Should be corrected as below:

**2. Data Description**


# Critic 2
- Original Design

![](img/image4.jpg)

- Critic

The orientation of the *age_group* label on the x-axis can be challenging to read. This coincides with one of the **data-ink** principles on graph labeling where the orientation of label should be reader friendly.

- Makeover

We will group the data using the code chunk below.

```{r}
participants$age_group <- cut(participants$age,
                                  breaks = c(-Inf,21, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46, 51, 56, Inf),
                                  labels = c("<20", "21-25", "26-30","31-35", "36-40", 
                                             "41-45", "46-50","51-55", "56-60"),
                                  right = FALSE)
```

The code chunk below plots a bar chart by using `geom_bar()` of **ggplot2**, with the use of `coord_flip()` to correct the orientation of the label.

```{r}
ggplot(data = participants,
       aes(x=age_group)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=paste0(..count..)), check_overlap=TRUE, colour="blue", fontface="bold", 
            position=position_stack(vjust = 1.04)) +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("No. of Participants") +
  ggtitle("Age Distribution")

```

# Critic 3
- Original Design

![](img/image5.jpg)

- Critic

Beside the issue with the orientation of the x-axis label as mentioned earlier, the legend of the graph is also missing. In addition, the choice of the dot size seems to have caused a slight overlap to one of the point labels (0.61).

- Makeover

The code chunk below plots a line chart with the use of `stat_summary()` of **ggplot2**. Legend has been added and point labels have been revised to make them more appealing.

```{r}
ggplot(data = participants,
       aes(x=age_group, y=joviality, color=haveKids, group = haveKids)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(aes(label = round(..y.., 2)), fun.y=mean, geom = "label_repel", segment.size = 0) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 1)) +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("Joviality") +
  ggtitle("Joviality across Age Groups by Kids Status")

```

# Critic 4
- Original Design

![](img/image6.jpg)

- Critic

Beside the issue with the orientation of the x-axis label as mentioned earlier, the legend of the graph is also not properly placed. In addition, the choice of the line/dot size seems to have resulted to much overlaps.

- Makeover

The code chunk below plots a line chart with the use of `stat_summary()` of **ggplot2**. Legend has been properly placed to the right-hand side of the graph and line/dot size has been shrunk to avoid unnecessary overlaps. This is in accordance to the principle of **showing the data clearly**.


```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}
ggplot(data = participants,
       aes(x=age_group, y=joviality, color=educationLevel, group = educationLevel)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = "line") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 1)) +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("Joviality") +
  ggtitle("Joviality across Age Groups by Education Level")

```

# Critic 5
- Original Design

![](img/image7.jpg)

- Critic

The graph title is missing and the bars are not sorted by their respective frequencies.

- Makeover

The code chunk below plots a bar chart by using `geom_bar()` of **ggplot2**, with the use of `ggtitle()` to add a graph title and bars are now sorted according to their respective frequencies.

```{r}
ggplot(data = participants,
       aes(x=reorder(interestGroup, interestGroup, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar(fill="skyblue") +
  ylim(0, 120) +
  geom_text(stat="count", 
      aes(label=paste0(..count.., " (", 
      round(..count../sum(..count..)*100,
            1), "%)")),
      vjust=-1, size=2.7) +
  xlab("Education Level") +
  ylab("No. of\nParticipants") +
  ggtitle("Education Level of Participants")
```

# Critic 6
- Original Design

![](img/image8.jpg)

- Critic

The composite graph title is missing and the 3 charts have been combined in a manner that many parts have overlaps, making it hard for us to capture the information clearly from this dashboard.

- Makeover

The code chunk below creates a composite plot by using the **patchwork** package, with the use of `plot_annotation()` to add an overall graph title as well as subplots tagging.

Note: p1 - p3 are assigned to plots presented earlier.

```{r echo = FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = participants,
       aes(x=age_group)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=paste0(..count..)), check_overlap=TRUE, colour="blue", fontface="bold", 
            position=position_stack(vjust = 1.04)) +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("No. of Participants") +
  ggtitle("Age Distribution")

p2 <- ggplot(data = participants,
       aes(x=age_group, y=joviality, color=haveKids, group = haveKids)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(aes(label = round(..y.., 2)), fun.y=mean, geom = "label_repel", segment.size = 0) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 1)) +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("Joviality") +
  ggtitle("Joviality across Age Groups by Kids Status")

p3 <- ggplot(data = participants,
       aes(x=age_group, y=joviality, color=educationLevel, group = educationLevel)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = "line") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 1)) +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("Joviality") +
  ggtitle("Joviality across Age Groups by Education Level")
```

```{r fig.height = 16, fig.width = 16}
patchwork <- ((p1 | p2)/ p3) + 
              plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I', title = 'Demographic of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA')
patchwork & theme_economist()
```
