# Overview

In this take-home exercise, appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods are used to reveal the economic of the [city of Engagement, Ohio USA](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/). 

The data are processed by using appropriate **tidyverse** family of packages and the statistical graphics are prepared using **ggplot2** and its extensions.

# Sketch of Proposed Design

The picture below shows a sketch of the initial design proposed.

# Installing & Lauching R Packages

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'ggdist', 'ggridges', 'patchwork', 'ggthemes')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# Importing Data

The code chunk below imports *Participants.csv* from the data folder into R by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package and save it as an tibble data frame called *participants*.

```{r}
participants <- read_csv("data/Participants.csv")

glimpse(participants)
```
