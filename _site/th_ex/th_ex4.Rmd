```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      fig.retina = 3)
```


# Task

**Challenge 2: Patterns of Life** considers the patterns of daily life throughout the city. You will describe the daily routines for some representative people, characterize the travel patterns to identify potential bottlenecks or hazards, and examine how these patterns change over time and seasons.

In Challenge 2, you will use visual analytic techniques to address these questions:

- Participants have given permission to have their daily routines captured. Choose two different participants with different routines and describe their daily patterns, with supporting evidence. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.

# Overview

In this take-home exercise, [**ViSiElse**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ViSiElse/index.html) and other appropriate visual analytics methods are used to reveal the life patterns of the [city of Engagement, Ohio USA](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/) while addressing the questions stated in the Task section.

The data are processed by using appropriate **tidyverse** family of packages.

# Sketch of Proposed Design

The picture below shows a sketch of the initial design proposed.

# Installing & Launching R Packages

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'data.table', 'knitr', 'ViSiElse', 'kableExtra', 'lubridate')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}

```

# Importing Data

The code chunk below imports *ActivityLogs files* from the rawdata folder into R by using [`list.files()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.files.html), [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package, and `map_df()` of [**purrr**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/purrr/versions/0.2.5) package, and and save it as a tibble data frame called *logs*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
memory.limit(size=160000)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
logs <- list.files(path = "./rawdata/ActivityLogs/",
                   pattern = "*.csv", 
                   full.names = T) %>% 
  map_df(~read_csv(., 
                   col_types = cols(.default = "c"))) 
```


# Data Wrangling

During our data exploration, we realized some of the participants starts off with *unstable* financial status while some having *stable* financial status. As such, we will choose 1 participant each, with partipantId 4 from the *unstable* financial status group and partipantId 7 from the *stable* financial status group, and to look after their differing routines.

![](img/image10.jpg)

The code chunk below limits our *logs* data to the only selected participants using `filter()` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
logs_two_p <- logs %>%
  filter(participantId == '4' | participantId == '7')
```

Data frame *logs_two_p* is saved in RDS format to avoid uploading large files to Git.

```{r eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(logs_two_p, 'data/logs_two_p.rds')
```

```{r}
logs_two_p <- readRDS('data/logs_two_p.rds')
```

We will use `kable()` to review the structure of the data frame and `kable_classic` of **kableExtra** has been applied to ensure the full width of the table can be preserved.

```{r}
kable(head(logs_two_p), format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:40%;'" ) %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = T, position = "center", )
```

We will add *date* and *year_month* columns for further analysis.

```{r}
logs_two_p$date <- date(logs_two_p$`timestamp`)
logs_two_p$year_month <- format(as.Date(logs_two_p$`timestamp`), "%Y-%m")
```


Let's look at the different activities from *currentMode*:

```{r echo=FALSE}
unique(logs_two_p$currentMode)
```


We will now calculate the duration of each activity in seconds and transform data using `pivot_wider()` of **tidyr** to suit the usage for `visielse()` visuals.

```{r}
logs_daily_ss <- logs_two_p %>%
  group_by(date, participantId, currentMode) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(ss = count * 60) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(date, participantId, currentMode, ss) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=currentMode, values_from=ss,
              values_fill=0)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(logs_daily_ss))
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
logs_daily_ss <- logs_daily_ss %>%
  mutate(participantId = as.character(participantId)) %>%
  select(2:7)
```


# ViSiElse Plot

Before plotting, we will set an order to the activities using the code chunk below:

```{r}
logs_daily_ss <- logs_daily_ss[,c(1,2,5,4,3,6)]
```


```{r}
visielse(logs_daily_ss, group = logs_daily_ss$participantId, informer = NULL, method = "cut", pixel = 200)
```

We realize that in general Participant 4 is spending less time in restaurant and at recreation than Participant 7, possibly due to his unstable financials status. This is more obvious in the difference in time spent for recreation where Participant 4 might want to restrict his non-necessity related spending in order to improve his financial outlook. This also aligns with the time spent at home where Participant * spent much more time at home than Participant 7. We also spot that both participants are having the same amount of time spent at work. As for transport perspective, Participant 4 is spending less time than Participant 7, potentially due to a closer location from home.
