```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      fig.retina = 3)
```


# Task

**Challenge 2: Patterns of Life** considers the patterns of daily life throughout the city. You will describe the daily routines for some representative people, characterize the travel patterns to identify potential bottlenecks or hazards, and examine how these patterns change over time and seasons.

In Challenge 2, you will use visual analytic techniques to address these questions:

- Participants have given permission to have their daily routines captured. Choose two different participants with different routines and describe their daily patterns, with supporting evidence. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.

# Overview

In this take-home exercise, [**ViSiElse**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ViSiElse/index.html) and other appropriate visual analytics methods are used to reveal the life patterns of the [city of Engagement, Ohio USA](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/) while addressing the questions stated in the Task section.

The data are processed by using appropriate **tidyverse** family of packages and the statistical graphics are prepared using **ggplot2** and its extensions.

# Sketch of Proposed Design

The picture below shows a sketch of the initial design proposed.

# Installing & Launching R Packages

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'ggdist', 'ggridges', 'patchwork', 'ggthemes', 'lubridate', 'ggiraph', 'gganimate', 'plotly', 'DT', 'crosstalk')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}

```

# Importing Data

The code chunk below imports *TravelJournal.csv* from the data folder into R by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package and save it as a tibble data frame called *travel*.

```{r}
travel <- read_csv("rawdata/TravelJournal.csv")

summary(travel)
```
