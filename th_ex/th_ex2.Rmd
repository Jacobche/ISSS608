# Overview

In this take-home exercise, I will critic [Ding Yanmu](https://dingyanmu.netlify.app/th_ex/th_ex1.html)'s Take-home Exercise 1 submission in terms of clarity and aesthetics. I will also remake the original design by applying the data visualisation principles and best practice we had learnt in Lesson 1 and 2.
