# Overview

In this take-home exercise, appropriate static statistical graphics methods are used to reveal the demographic of the [city of Engagement, Ohio USA](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/). 

The data are processed by using appropriate **tidyverse** family of packages and the statistical graphics are prepared using **ggplot2** and its extensions.

# Sketch of Proposed Design

The picture below shows a sketch of the initial design proposed.

# Installing & Lauching R Packages

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'ggdist', 'ggridges')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# Importing Data

The code chunk below imports *Participants.csv* from the data folder into R by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package and save it as an tibble data frame called *participants*.

```{r}
participants <- read_csv("data/Participants.csv")

glimpse(participants)
```

# Static Bar Chart

We will examine the education level of the participants in this data set. The code chunk below plots a bar chart by using `geom_bar()` of **ggplot2**.

```{r}
ggplot(data = participants,
       aes(x=reorder(educationLevel, educationLevel, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  ylim(0,550) +
  geom_text(stat="count", 
      aes(label=paste0(..count.., " (", 
      round(..count../sum(..count..)*100,
            1), "%)")),
      vjust=-1) +
  xlab("Education Level") +
  ylab("No. of\nParticipants") +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                        colour = "lightblue",
                                        size = 0.5,
                                        linetype = "solid"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                        linetype = 'solid',
                                        colour = "white"), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.25, 
                                        linetype = 'solid',
                                        colour = "white"))
```
# Static Trellis Boxplot

We will examine the joviality distribution of the participants by interest groups by kids status in this data set. The code chunk below plots a bar chart by using `geom_boxplot()` of **ggplot2**.

```{r}
ggplot(data=participants, 
       aes(y = joviality, x= interestGroup)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(geom = "point",
               fun.y="mean",
               colour ="red",
               size=3) +
  facet_grid(haveKids ~.)
```

# Static Raincoud Plots

[*Joviality*](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/joviality#:~:text=Joviality%20is%20the%20characteristic%20of,dinner%20might%20cheer%20you%20up.) is defined as the characteristic of being cheerful and festive. A higher joviality index would represent a greater level of cheerfulness. 

We will examine the joviality spread of the participants across the education levels in this data set. The code chunk below creates raincloud plots by using `stat_halfeye()` of **ggdist** and `geom_boxplot()` of **ggplot2**.

```{r}
ggplot(participants, aes(x = educationLevel, y = joviality)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2), 
                     limits = c(0, 1)) + 
  stat_halfeye(adjust = .33, 
               width = .67, 
               color = NA,
               justification = -.01,
               position = position_nudge(
                 x = .15)
  ) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = .25,
    outlier.shape = NA
  ) +
  # stat_dots(side = "left",
  #           justification = 0.1,
  #           binwidth = .1,
  #           dotsize = .1) 
  coord_flip()
```


# Static Ridge Plot

We will examine the joviality spread of the participants across the interest groups in this data set. The code chunk below creates a ridge plot by using `geom_density_ridges()` of **ggridges**, an ggplot2 extension specially designed to create ridge plot.

```{r}
ggplot(participants, 
       aes(x = joviality, y = interestGroup)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(rel_min_height = 0.01,
                      scale = 1)
```
